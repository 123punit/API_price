# API_price
I have used BDD approach to complete this assessment.
**#** In **Src/main/java** folder: I have kept **Price.Feaure** file and **PriceStepdefinition.java**  file.
**Price.Feature** consists of all acceptance steps for automation testing. In Ghekin language. Gherkin is simple English language. Which help to understand the test steps for non technical person.
**PriceStepdefinition.java** holds the test method and code which are mapped to the Gherkin test case steps on the feature file.
**#** **Src/test/java** folder: I have kept **PriceTestRunner.java** file.
**PriceTestRunner.java** executes the Cucumber feature files and coordinates the steps defined in those feature files with the corresponding step definitions. In his file we passed the location of feature and step definition file and along with the some reporting and other methods supported by cucumber.
**#** In **src/test/resouces**: **currency_schema.json** file present.
**#** Run the Project:
**Select > PriceTestRunner.java > click on Run as > Junit test**
